# Capstone Project: Biodiversity in National Parks

**Analyze data about endangered species** (A Project from: [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/analyze-data-with-python/tracks/ida-8-final-projects/modules/ida-8-2-capstones/informationals/ida-capstone-biodiversity))

***Scenario:***
For this project, you’ll act as a data analyst for the National Park Service. You’ll be helping them analyze data on endangered species from several different parks.

The National Parks Service would like you to perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and to investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data, pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.

After you perform analysis, you’ll be creating a presentation to share your findings with the National Park Service.
